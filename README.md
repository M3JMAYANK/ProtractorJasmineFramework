Jasmine Test for Automating Angular JS application

Jasmine is a test framework, which provides BDD (Behavior Driven Development) functionalities for your automation framework. It is an independent framework i.e there is no dependency with other framework and doesnâ€™t require DOM. A describe-block, it-block, and an expectation with matcher makes one complete test script.
